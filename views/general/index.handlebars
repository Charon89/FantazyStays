        <h3>1. How does Fantasy Stays work?</h3>
        <p>Fantasy Stays is an online marketplace which lets people rent out their properties or spare rooms to
            guests.
            Fantasy Stays
            takes 3%
            commission of every booking from hosts, and between 6% and 12% from guests. There’s plenty of criteria
            to
            list
            for/search a property: from a shared room to an entire house, to having a swimming pool to having a
            washing
            machine.
            There are photos of the property, and the hosts/guests, with full map listing.</p>
        <h3>2. Why do people like it?</h3>
        <p>A combination of factors, but primarily financial ones. Guests get good value accommodation at a huge
            range
            of
            price
            points, from a few pounds a night to hundreds and often in prime locations where a normal hotel would
            cost
            infinitely
            more. Hosts can cash in on spare space, perhaps if children have flown the nest and there’s a spare
            bedroom.
            In
            fact,
            according to economist Dr Margarethe Theseira, if an Fantasy Stays host lists their property for seven
            days
            a
            month on
            average
            they would earn £5,600 per year, a boost to household income equivalent to a 15% pay rise for an average
            full-time
            employee.</p>
        <h3>3. What are the other benefits?</h3>
        <p>There is more than a financial impetus though: many guests like living like a local and getting
            restaurant
            recommendations from people really in-the-know, while many hosts just enjoy meeting new people and
            showing
            off
            their
            home. 4. Is it easy to book? Yes, very. Once you’ve created a verified profile (which can be linked to
            social
            media),
            you can send a message to the host and either book instantly, or submit a request for later booking.
            Hosts
            must
            show
            calendars of availability - most are kept well up-to-date - and they will inform you of what they will
            provide
            like
            towels or hairdryers. It’s not advised if you’re travelling through though - many people don’t take
            bookings
            for
            just
            one night.</p>
